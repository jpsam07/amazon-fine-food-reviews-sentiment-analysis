# Sentiment Analysis on Amazon Fine Food Reviews

![README banner](./images/writing_for_food_on_amazon.jpg)

This is a natural language processing project (NLP) using Python with NLTK, and Hugging Face Roberta Transformers to analyze fine food sentiments on Amazon

This project utilized **3 different approaches for sentiment analysis**:

1. [Valence Aware Dictionary and sEntiment Reasoner (VADER)](#VADER-Model) - Bag of words approach
2. [Roberta Pre-trained model](#Roberta-Pre-trained-Model) from Hugging Face ðŸ¤—  
3. [Hugging Face Transformers Pipeline](#Hugging-Face-Transformers-Pipeline)

## Data Collection

> [!NOTE]
> The procedure as to how the dataset was sampled and collected can be viewed in this [Kaggle Notebook](https://www.kaggle.com/code/joaquinsamson/preparing-data-for-sentiment-analysis)
## Environment Setup and Data Loading

- Loaded in the randomly sampled data from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/code/joaquinsamson/preparing-data-for-sentiment-analysis) into Jupyter Lab.
- Imported required libraries for analysis:
	- `pandas`: for data management and manipulation
	- `pyarrow`: for loading in parquet files
	- `numpy` & `scipy`: for numerical and scientific computing
	- `matplotlib`, `seaborn`: for data visualization and exploration
	- `nltk`: Natural Language Toolkit, a dedicated Python library for natural language processing (contains the VADER Model)
	- `tqdm`: for bar animations indicating the progress of tasks
	- `transformers`: for using Hugging Face transformers and pipelines

> [!NOTE] 
> Even when you have installed the `nltk` library, you will still need to download additional dependencies for it.

```python
nltk.download('popular') 
nltk.download('vader_lexicon')
```

Once you have run those lines of code, you can proceed to turn them into comments.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

- Used the `.info()` method for a quick overview of the data

![Data overview with the info method](./images/data_overview_with_info_method.png)

- Checked for missing values

![Checking for missing values](./images/checking_for_missing_values.png)

- Visualized food review counts by ratings

## NLTK Text Preprocessing

**Image Source:** [Oreilly](https://www.oreilly.com/api/v2/epubs/9781492074076/files/assets/btap_0401.png)

Did the following text preprocessing techniques:

1. Tokenization
2. POS Tagging
3. Stop Word Removal
4. Lemmatization

## VADER Model

- Created a `SentimentIntensityAnalyzer` object for [Polarity Scoring](#polarity-scoring)

![Sentiment Intensity Analyzer Object](./images/sia_object.png)

- Tested out polarity scoring method

![Testing polarity scoring method](./images/testing_polarity_scoring_method.png)

- Applied polarity scoring on the whole dataset and plotted the compound score by star review

![Compound Score by Star Review](./images/vader_compound_score_by_star_review.png)

- Plotted the polarity scores by sentiment category

![Polarity Scores by Sentiment Category](./images/vader_polarity_scores_by_sentiment_category.png)

## Roberta Pre-Trained Model

- Imported the `AutoTokenizer`  `AutoModelForSequenceClassification` modules from `transformers`
- Imported `softmax` module from `scipy`
- Did polarity scoring on the whole dataset


## Roberta Model vs. VADER Model

- Plotted the polarity scores of the VADER Model against the Roberta Model

## Hugging Face Transformers Pipeline

- Imported the `pipeline` module from `transformers`
- Created a pipeline object for sentiment analysis

![Hugging Face Pipeline object](./images/huggingface_pipeline_object.png)

- Tested the pipeline object on sample text for sentiment scoring

![Testing out Hugging Face Pipeline](./images/testing_out_huggingface_pipeline.png)

## Conclusion

- Based on the pairplot between the VADER and Roberta model, **there are some correlations between them**
- **The Roberta Model looks to be the more reliable model** as it is more confident in its predictions compared to the VADER model
- While the Roberta model is better, **it's not exempted from having errors** in giving out sentiment scores.
- The **Hugging Face Transformers pipeline** allows you to have **sentiment analysis results with essentially 2 lines of code.**
